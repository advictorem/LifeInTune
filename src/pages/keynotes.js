                  King, alongside Muhammad Ali, Robert Kennedy Jr. and Maya
                  Angelou, playing the GRAMMY’s with Prince, recording with
                  Madonna and packing stadiums with Afro-Latin-Blues-Rock legend
                  Carlos Santana. Driving home the message that when we LISTEN

                  Music’s the great invitation For mankind to transcend spoken
                  word To enhance how we think And put into sync So we hear what
                  is mostly not heard.

                  Those words, from his number-one charting release, If Music
                  Could Speak, sum up the central message of everything Freddie
                  Ravel. Hailing from parents of Latin American and Eastern
                  European decent, his humble beginnings as a newspaper boy to
                  his rise as an internationally-renowned musical ambassador,
                  Ravel is a living example of the classic American success
                  story, highlighting that our strength and competitive
                  advantage as a nation lie in our diverse cultural roots and
                  experiences. Combined with his unrivaled passion for music and
                  business, Ravel unlocks the minds, hearts and potential of
                  audiences around the world.

                  For his ongoing contributions to education through music,
                  Ravel was recently knighted by the Knights of St. John, an
                  organization who has championed hospitals and healthcare for
                  over a 1,000 years. In this interactive program, Ravel
                  combines proven solutions towards resolving conflicts and
                  brings meaningful dialogue backed by scientific data and
                  creative musical expression to appeal to the mind, body and
                  soul of your conference participants.
